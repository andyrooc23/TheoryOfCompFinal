# Part 1: _Fibonacci_ Sphere
<p>
Concerning the first portion of the final project, we can see that
after running the program that we have a list of x,y,z coordinates 
such that if we were to map out each individual coordinate, we would
find that no ball of the given size would be able to pass through
the sphere. This proves that this Fibonacci sphere of n points can
be built such that it satisfies all the given constraints.

To use:<br>
Simply change the n and r variables in the main method in order to
see a different output.


# Part 2: DFA Minimization
This code generates a new table of minimized states. To minimize your
own DFA simply copy the format shown in input1.txt and run the python script again.
